/**
 * This file provides some tests for ArrayDictionary methods.
 *
 * Note that many tests depend on basic functionality such as put and get since the
 * `makeBasicDictionary` and `assertDictMatches` helper methods use these methods, so tests for
 * other methods may fail if these basic `ArrayDictionary` methods do not function correctly.
 *
 * In general, make sure that tests named with "basic" at the beginning are passing before attempting
 * to debug issues with other tests. (This will not guarantee that the basic methods are functioning
 * correctly, but may help distinguish between issues that tests are attempting to check for and
 * issues with other functionality that the tests require.)
 *
 * Changes in this file will be ignored during grading.
